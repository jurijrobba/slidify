## Data

 * We are using dataset called 'mtcars'
 * Data extracted from 1974 Motor Trend US magazine
 * Only interested in miles per gallon and transmission

---

## Data

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(mtcars[,c(1,9)])
```

---

## Problem

 * We are comparing miles per galon for automatic and manual transmission
 * We want to compare histograms at different number of bins (different bin sizes)
 * X-axis of histograms need to be aligned for comparison

---

## Different resolutions

 * We are interested in between 1 to 50 bins
 * Number of bins needs to be user selectable (achioeved with slider)

---

## Conclusion

 * No matter bin resolution driving manual was more efficient in 1974!
